## General Information

This intelligent transport system project aims to reduce manpower needed for an autonomous vehicle test trial by building dynamic roadblocks (a.k.a Smart traffic lights). Cameras are installed to monitor traffic conditions so that the traffic light can make a better decision on what the logic should be. To determine the traffic situation, tiny-YOLO, a computer vision model is used to detect and count the vehicle.
